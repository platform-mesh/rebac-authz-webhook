# Platform Mesh - rebac-authz-webhook
![Build Status](https://github.com/platform-mesh/rebac-authz-webhook/actions/workflows/pipeline.yaml/badge.svg)

## Description

The Platform Mesh IAM Authorizaton Webhook is a kubernetes authorization webhook that uses openFGA to answer authorization requests from kubernetes.

## KCP Configuration

The webhook requires access to the Root KCP API Server (not Virtual Workspace) for API Server Discovery. This is necessary because:

- `cache.New()` inside the provider needs Root KCP API Server to discover `APIExportEndpointSlice` resources
- Virtual Workspace kubeconfig doesn't support API Server Discovery for root KCP CRDs like `APIExportEndpointSlice`
- The provider will then use Virtual Workspace URLs from the endpoint slice for actual cluster access

The webhook uses `ctrl.GetConfigOrDie()` which respects the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. The Helm chart deployment template sets this environment variable to point to a kubeconfig secret provided by the platform-mesh-operator that contains the Root KCP API Server URL.

The default `apiExportEndpointSliceName` is `"core.platform-mesh.io"` (configured in the code). This can be overridden via the `--kcp-api-export-endpoint-slice-name` command-line argument if needed.

## Releasing

The release is performed automatically through a GitHub Actions Workflow.

All the released versions will be available as packages on this GitHub repository.

## Requirements

To build an run the webhook locally a installation of go is required. Checkout the [go.mod](go.mod) for the required go version.
In order to build the Dockerfile a compatible tooling like docker or podman is required.
